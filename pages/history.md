Pertinent events and articles showing the aerosol nature of infection has been talked about for other diseases over the years. For the sake of this timeline, **aerosol** = **airborne** = **droplet nuclei**. These less-than 5 μm particles float in the air for some time and travel some distance. Whereas **droplets** (larger than 5 μm) fall under gravity to a surface - possibly within 2 meters.

Note: the medical and science communities currently debate whether **100** μm not **5** μm is the cutover from aerosol to droplet. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30323-4/fulltext">[read more]</a>
