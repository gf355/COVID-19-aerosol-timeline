# Purpose of the aerosol timeline 

The purpose of creating this timeline is to use scientific evidence of COVID-19 aerosol transmission to support Canadian frontline nurses, who are underprotected. For more information, please refer to this article: https://nursesunions.ca/governments-must-update-their-guidance-for-health-care-workers-to-recognize-and-respond-to-the-science-on-covid-19-transmission/ 

# Add/modify events to this timeline via pull requests

Change these files and make a pull request: 

1. https://github.com/gf355/COVID-19-aerosol-timeline/blob/main/media/aerosol-timeline.json (directly pertinent to COVID-19)
2. https://github.com/gf355/COVID-19-aerosol-timeline/blob/main/media/aerosol-history-timeline.json (history over the decades of science and events that support an aerosol hypothesis for infection of various diseases - mostly "beakthrough" -centric)
