# Purpose

The purpose of creating this timeline is to use scientific evidence of COVID-19 aerosol transmission to support Canadian frontline nurses, who are underprotected. For more information, please refer to this article: https://nursesunions.ca/governments-must-update-their-guidance-for-health-care-workers-to-recognize-and-respond-to-the-science-on-covid-19-transmission/
